# Con(ZFC) in Diophantine form

**Explicit polynomials with fixed integer coefficients whose unsolvability
ZFC proves equivalent to Con(ZFC): seven wave-5 syntheses on the blank run of
K215, with ten unrestricted integers via Sun's reduction, fourteen via Jones,
and twelve positive unknowns at degree 1022**

This report holds seven AI-assisted research packages, dated 22–23 October
2026. They are batch 221 of ProveIt's incoming reports (arrival
`b7f8b75b5b`, "Con(ZFC) in Diophantine form (wave-5)"), placed in
`952c1fab49`.

- All seven are pinned to `8c6eec9d19`, which contains this report's
  audited wave-4 form.
- They cite wave-4 packages by their source numbers 24–30.
- No wave-5 package cites another wave-5 package.

## Earlier waves are superseded

As for waves 3 and 4 (Vladimir's direction), wave 5 supersedes wave 4.
Directories `24-integer24/` … `30-quartic31/` were removed from the tree when
wave 5 was placed.

| Wave | Batch | Arrival (archives) | Directories in every commit from … to … | Audited README |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 217 | `2fd49a1a9d` | `084e120830` … `8a4b00b5bf^` | `f3af223ef7` |
| 2 | 218 | `7be2780f26` | `8a4b00b5bf` … `da064316ea^` | `5b0c9ae9fd` |
| 3 | 219 | `cbf94cb552` | `da064316ea` … `604b1416b5^` | `a477d0fc8b` |
| 4 | 220 | `375cc6e3d7` | `604b1416b5` … `952c1fab49^` | `52f475c7a7` |
| 5 | 221 | `b7f8b75b5b` | `952c1fab49` … | this file |

Source numbers 01–30 are kept only because the packages' texts use them; the
wave-5 directories continue the sequence as 31–37.

All seven wave-5 packages bundle a copy of the audited wave-4 README:

| Package | Copy |
|---|---|
| 31 | `sources/COLLECTION_AT_PIN.md` |
| 32 | `references/COMPARISON_AT_PIN.md` |
| 33 | `upstream/reviewed_README.md` |
| 34 | `review/README.md` |
| 35 | `sources/catalogue/README.md` |
| 36 | `evidence/COMPARISON_AT_PIN.md` |
| 37 | `sources/README.md` |

Several packages also bundle wave-4 circuits as reference material. These
copies stay bound to their original wave-4 tuples, and they describe a
superseded wave.

**Wave-4 results that wave 5 does not reproduce or rebind** (an intake
comparison by blob matching against the wave-4 tree):

| Wave-4 result | Byte copy in the wave-5 tree |
|---|---|
| 30's 25ℤ / 920 / 131 and 26ℤ / 214 / 123 forms (system 128 / 117) | `37-wave5/lowdegree/upstream/integers/` |
| 24's 24ℤ / 1936 / 167 and 26's 24ℤ / 2432 / 163 | `34-integer14/review/24-integer24/`, `34-integer14/review/26-ratio12/` |
| 27's 24ℤ / 1936 / 168 and 30's 24ℤ / 2240 / 165 | none (history only) |
| 27's nine-positive form at 1537 ops (new majorant) | `34-integer14/review/27-wave4/nine/generated/` |
| 27's 1480-op nine-positive form of 18's circuit and its literal-weight variants | none (history only) |
| 24's 13-unknown forms 319 / 89 and 288 / 81 | none (history only) |
| the 42ℤ sextic and 36ℤ octic (27, 29) | none (history only) |
| 27's 59-op systems of degree 12, 10, 8, 6 (17–20 unknowns) | none (history only) |
| the 16 / 7 / 22 / 60 system (27, 30) | none (history only) |

The byte copies of 24's, 26's and 27's circuits are bound to coefficient
tuples whose payloads are not in the tree, so in practice they too are
usable only from history. To read the results that are in history only,
use the wave-4 README and
directories at `52f475c7a7`, e.g.
`git show 52f475c7a7:<this directory>/README.md`. Earlier waves' lost results
are listed in their own READMEs (see the wave table).

Some earlier results remain unbeaten on their own measures:

- the 67-operation equation P₆₇ (wave 1), for fewest operations;
- the 59-operation 16 / 7 / 24 system;
- wave-2 Q₅₆ (15 / 1 / 56 / 74) and the 33ℤ / 1 / 159 / 134 polynomial;
- the history-only items above: 27's low-degree 59-operation systems, 24's
  13-unknown forms, and 27's nine-positive forms at 1480 operations
  (majorant) and 1473 (literal weights), which still have fewer
  operations than any wave-5 nine-unknown form.

36 ships P₆₇ and the 59-operation system rebound to its coefficients, and
31 bundles the 59-operation system.

## How this report was made

The packages overlap, as before, so they are **placed, not written**
([docs/incoming/README.md](../../../../../../docs/incoming/README.md),
section 2):

- each package keeps its delivered layout and PDF in its numbered directory,
  with the wrapper removed;
- this README is the reconciliation note;
- no delivered file was edited, no PDF was built, and no delivered program
  was run at intake.

Facts are the packages' own, from two read-only intake dossiers. Their
scripts also evaluated delivered circuits modulo a large prime to tell
polynomials apart. Agreement at random points is strong evidence of
identity, not proof; disagreement proves the polynomials differ.

[`PLACEMENT.md`](PLACEMENT.md) is the recovery map for wave 5. Of the 1,197
archive members:

- 1,129 were staged;
- 46 were omitted as byte-identical (up to line ends) copies of repository
  files outside this report;
- 22 checksum ledgers and logs were excluded by the root `.gitignore`.

## The common theorem

Each package defines polynomials or small systems with four **fixed integer
coefficient ports**:

- Bm1 = B − 1;
- Kconstant = D_C + B·D_R;
- MC;
- the **shifted** MF = (native high mask) + B − 1.

The ports are determined by a finite recipe from the literal 215-state
machine
[`candidate-k215/k215.tm`](../../../../../../Computability/BusyBeaver/Research/ZFC/candidate-k215/k215.tm),
and each package proves, by ordinary mathematics formalizable in ZFC, that

> ZFC ⊢ (no solution in the stated domain) ↔ Con(ZFC).

The route is unchanged:

1. the blank run of K215 halts iff ZFC has a finite refutation;
2. a local tile language of that run is compiled by the repository's
   native-window/Pell compiler
   ([`native-stream-queue/`](../../../../../../Computability/HilbertTenthProblem/Papers/research-wip/native-stream-queue/README.md))
   with its input interface removed.

The low-variable forms then apply a reduction to a fixed quartic:

- the Matiyasevich–Jones nine-variable reduction, for the 9ℕ and signed
  14–17ℤ forms;
- for 31's 10ℤ form, Sun's ten-integer reduction.

The quartic is the 31-unknown one of wave-4 package 30, except in 32's
15ℤ and 16ℤ forms, which use ν = 32 and package 29's T4 quartic32.

## The seven packages

Numbers are the packages' own; **none was re-derived at intake.** "u / e / d
/ o" means unknowns / equations / degree / operations, with L = 5^32.
Operations count every binary +, −, × including multiplication by fixed
numerals; reuse and system comparisons are free. Unknowns are strictly
positive unless marked ℤ (unrestricted integers) or ℕ (naturals).

## Frontier, credits and bases (intake findings)

The base is the earliest-arriving package that presents the construction in
full; where only one package has it, that package.

| Criterion | Best stated | Found by | Base |
|---|---|---|---|
| Fewest unrestricted integers | **10ℤ**: degree 126496·5^31 + 27064 (about 5.9·10^26), 1,442 ops; instantiates Sun's 2026 ten-integer reduction (preprint arXiv:2609.01594v2, cited, not reproduced, not checked at intake) on 30's quartic | 31 only | 31 |
| Fewest unrestricted integers, Jones route | **14ℤ**: 37 (813056·L + 2752, 1524 ops) beats 34 (813056·L + 2152 at 1586 ops) on operations, and 34 beats 37 on degree; different polynomials | 34, 37 | 34 |
| 15ℤ and 16ℤ | 15ℤ: 37 (813056·L + 4184 / 1530), 34 (406528·L + 2528 / 1594), 32 (813056·5^33 + 4184 / 1541, ν = 32, T4 tuple). 16ℤ: 31, 32, 33, 35 and 37, all different polynomials (33's and 37's share the degree 406528·L + 10008 but differ in their parent-quartic records, checked by the audit); fewest ops 37 (1537) | 37, 34, 32; 31, 32, 33, 35, 37 | 34 for 15ℤ; 31 for 16ℤ, 37 for operations |
| Nine unknowns | **degree 92324·L + 296**, 9 positive at 1500 ops (37) or 1554 (34), over ℕ 1505 / 1559: different polynomials (different templates and tuples, checked by the audit). 37 also has degree 93264·L + 288 at 1498 positive / 1503 ℕ. Wave-4 27's history-only 1480 / 1473 still have fewer operations | 34, 37 | 34 |
| Twelve positive, lowest degree | **1022** at 124 ops, then 1023 / 119, 1025 / 116, 1033 / 114, 1041 / 111; systems 1014 / 115, 1016 / 112, 1024 / 110 (all 34). 34's 1025 / 116 product and 1016 / 112 system dominate 37's 1061 / 120 (system 1052 / 114) and 35's and 37's 1065 forms (the same template on different tuples) | 34 | 34 |
| Twelve positive, fewest operations | **108** (31, 32, 33, 35): all are 30's degree-1081 polynomial evaluated more cheaply. 31's, 32's and 35's are the same fixed polynomial (identical tuples), and 33's is 30's own fixed polynomial. Systems: **102** (31, shifted) | 31, 32, 33, 35 | 31 |
| 31-unknown positive quartic | system **60** ops, SOS 125 (31); 61 / 126 (33); 62 / 127 (35), each 30's quartic under affine coordinate changes | 31, 33, 35 | 31 |
| Integer quartic | **50ℤ** (34, 37: they differ in one of 29 residuals, checked by the audit) | 34, 37 | 34 |
| 24ℤ at moderate degree | 37's 1936 / 161 (system 156), a different polynomial from wave-4 24's and 27's 1936 forms (smaller ratio weight) | 37 | 37 |
| Fewest operations | **67** (P₆₇), unchanged; the 59-op 16 / 7 / 24 system unchanged | — | (wave 1) |
| Smallest coefficients binding an equation | **B = 2^1012115** (36, 506,664 raw bytes, largest port 1,016,946 bits). 33's optional 2^1012625 binds none but has fewer raw bytes (506,644) and a smaller largest port (1,015,251 bits), so "smallest" depends on the measure. 2^1064921 (31, 32, 35: one identical tuple; 34 shares only β) | 36 | 36 |

### Coefficient recipes: use one whole tuple

| Dir | B | Materialized | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 31 | 2^1064921 (ρ = 2^121, cell 8801, padding prime 2341) | raw and gzip, 533,099 raw bytes; Jones index z = 2^4269855 for its 16ℤ form | the same bytes as 32's and 35's tuple |
| 32 | 2^1064921 (31's tuple) for the positive forms; T4 (2^(5^18), not expanded) for the integer forms | gzip | "no unverified claim that the new tuple has been substituted" into the Jones forms |
| 33 | 30's 2^(5^10) for its equations; optional 2^1012625 | gzip | optional tuple binds no delivered equation |
| 34 | 2^1064921 with 31's β but different K, MC, MF | raw and gzip, 532,479 raw bytes; z = 2^4259933 and 78 fixed leaves | a different tuple from 31's |
| 35 | 2^1064921 (31's tuple) | raw and gzip; z = 2^4269855 | identical bytes to 31's |
| 36 | **2^1012115** (ρ = 2^115, padding prime 3433) | gzip, 506,664 raw bytes; new Jones index z = 2^4058127 (507,266 raw bytes) | replaces earlier tuples as a whole |
| 37 | 30's 2^(5^10) | raw and gzip; z = 2^45933757 (`nine/generated/z_index.bin`, identical to wave-4 30's) | calls 25's and 27's 2^(5^9) tuples "valid competing" choices |

- Every package binds its four ports as one tuple and forbids splicing.
- Jones forms need a fresh index on any rebinding (36).
- The dossiers' read-only checks confirm the stated hashes and byte sizes
  of the materialized payloads. They do not check the compiler theorem the
  bytes instantiate.

### Tensions, not adjudicated at intake

- **The square base.** 33 says replacing the base slack by a square "is not
  justified" (`report.tex:763-767`). Other forms use a square or cofinal
  base leaf, justified by inspecting the Lean proof of
  `Jones1982.USys_of_mem` (34's open question 2 notes the dependence):
  - 31's 16ℤ form (`kappa_index`);
  - 32's 15ℤ form (`b_floor`);
  - 34's 14ℤ form (`b_floor_odd`);
  - 35's 16ℤ form (`b_scale`);
  - 37's 14ℤ and 15ℤ forms (`base_scale`).

  32's, 33's and 37's 16ℤ forms and 34's 15ℤ form use the ordinary Jones
  index, so they do not depend on the contested step. That includes the
  16ℤ form with the fewest operations (37's, 1537).
- **Smallest-tuple claims.** 31, 32, 33, 35 and 36 each present their tuple
  as smaller than the pin's, without knowing of each other. 36's binds an
  equation and has the smallest B; 33's optional tuple, which binds nothing,
  has fewer bytes.
- **Like-for-like system counts.** 36 compares old *unshifted* systems
  (107, 118 ops) with its new *shifted* ones (103, 114) (`report.tex:117-119`;
  its README shows 107 → 103). Like for like, the new counts are 104 and
  115.
- **Corrections of wave 4.** 34 says wave-4 30's `positive/README.md` wrongly
  points to a nonexistent `coefficients/` folder; the wave-4 README already
  recorded this. 37 says wave-4 27's "same paper18 polynomial" is a template
  identity only, as the wave-4 README says, and qualifies the README's
  remark on 27's adapter (27's coefficient proof argues it). No package
  calls a wave-4 result or the wave-4 README wrong.

## What is not claimed

The packages say, in their own words (exceptions noted):

- **No new formal result.** New reductions are ordinary proofs with finite
  audits; there is no Lean or Rocq end-to-end certificate and no fresh
  endpoint build. Sun's reduction is not formalized anywhere in the
  repository (checked at intake: nothing in
  `Computability/HilbertTenthProblem`).
- **No new general theorem.** 31 "does not claim a new general ten-unknowns
  theorem or global optimality". The ten-integer reduction is attributed to
  Sun. 31's review says it is not an independent audit of Sun's Lucas
  theorems.
- **No consistency proof.** The theorems are equivalences. 32, 33 and 36
  add that a stronger two-sided claim is not made or needs an extra
  hypothesis. 31 and 35 give only the second-incompleteness remark. 34
  says it "does not decide either side" and 37 that it "does not prove
  either side".
- **Domains.** Positive and nine-variable equations must not be read over ℤ.
  31 warns that ten integers "should not be compared … as if the domains
  were identical".
- **No optimality.** No global minimum is claimed. Nothing below 67
  operations, eleven positive unknowns or nine unknowns is claimed.

## Relation to the formal developments

- **Machine endpoint.** The packages rest on the ordinary K215 calibration
  that `KEndpoint215.blank_halts_iff_zfc_refutation`
  (`Computability/BusyBeaver/Lean/BusyBeaver/ZFC/KEndpoint215.lean`, present
  at `HEAD`, not rebuilt) mirrors. The ZFC-provability claim does not go
  through Lean's soundness.
- **Jones.** The nine-variable and signed 14–17ℤ forms build on the
  parametric `Jones1982.Nine.wset_iff_nine` and its lemmas
  `Jones1982.Nine.ratio_complete`, `Jones1982.Nine.ratio_sound`,
  `Jones1982.Nine.reduced_of_mem`, `Jones1982.USys_of_mem` and
  `Jones1982.exists_B25core`. The packages often cite these by file
  prefix, as in `Master3.USys_of_mem`. The quartic is the fixed
  31-unknown one, or package 29's 32-unknown one for 32's integer
  forms. They do not use `Jones1982.nine_unknowns`, which fixes ν = 58.
  Their new finalizers, majorants, cofinal bases and Pell-orbit arguments
  are unformalized. Several argue from the Lean proofs' structure rather
  than from their statements.
- **Sun.** 31's ten-integer form depends on Sun's 2026 preprint (Proposition
  2.1, Theorems 3.1 and 4.1, Propositions 6.1–6.2, §7) and his 2021 paper.
  Sun's results are external, unformalized and were not checked at intake.
- **Nothing in this report is formalized.**

## Delivery discrepancies

These are disclosed here and were not fixed in the delivered files.

- **Drivers.** These drivers read files omitted at intake (`k215.tm`, Lean
  sources, `KEndpoint215.lean`) or ignored ledgers, and fail in place:

  | Dir | Driver |
  |---|---|
  | 31 | `verify_all.py` |
  | 32 | `verify_all.py` |
  | 33 | `reproduce.py`, including its default run (stage 4 hashes the omitted sources) |
  | 34 | `verify_release.py` (exact manifest; needs SymPy and NumPy) |
  | 35 | `reproduce.py` |
  | 37 | `verify.py` (needs NumPy and SymPy) |

  From reading the code (not running it), only 36's `verify.py` reads no
  omitted file. Rerun from the arrival commit, as
  `PLACEMENT.md` explains.
- **Licence and attribution.**
  - Notices of AI assistance:

    | Package | Notice |
    |---|---|
    | 31 | AI assistance (one line) |
    | 32 | OpenAI, no human review |
    | 33 | "Prepared with AI assistance"; "remain open to human review" |
    | 34 | OpenAI; "not external human endorsements" |
    | 35 | OpenAI, disclaiming human authorship |
    | 36 | AI-assisted, unnamed |
    | 37 | OpenAI; "No external human review" |

  - 33 states **no licence for its new material**.
  - Every package ships a K215 machine notice. 37 says it fixes wave-4
    27's omission of one.
  - 34 calls wave-4 30 "our preceding construction". 37 calls wave-4 27
    "the previous delivery".
- **Inside the packages.**
  - 31's `quartic31_sos125.json` carries `exact_degree: 4` together with
    the system's `exact_maximum_degree: 2`, equation count and
    comparisons.
  - 33's own earlier 1617-op circuit is superseded.
  - 34's `audit/SUN_SCOPE_NOTE.md` still speaks of a "new 16-variable
    construction".
  - 36's system comparison mixes shifted and unshifted counts (above).
  - 37 lists no open questions.
- **Retained intermediates.**
  - 31's comparison variants and its inactive reference instance.
  - 34's dominated `nine31_structured*` and undelivered
    `coefficients/exploration/`. Its superseded 16 / 17-variable forms are
    mentioned in prose only.
  - 36's folded nine-variable copies and an exploratory moment method.
  - 37's signed15 (813056·L + 4184 / 1530), which 37 calls dominated
    although it beats 32's and 34's 15ℤ forms on operations.
- **Bundled copies.** Some bundled Lean files differ from the repository's
  only by a trailing blank line, so they were kept: 32's, including
  `compiler/upstream/KEndpoint215.lean`; 34's `audit/ProductPell.lean.txt`
  and `audit/Ratio.lean.txt`; and 37's `review/upstream/Ratio.lean`.

## Further questions and research

These are the open problems the packages list, merged and credited:

1. **Formalize.** Sun's Lucas and interpolation theorems and the
   ten-integer adapter (31). The cofinal radix via `USys_of_mem` and the
   Pell-orbit lemma (32). The adapter and finalizers (35). The new lemmas
   generally (33, 34).
2. **Fewer unknowns.**
   - Below ten integers is a separate problem (31).
   - Instantiate Sun's route on the other packages' tuples (32, 33, 34,
     35).
   - Rebuild the Jones index at ν = 31 (32).
   - Remove more signed guards (35).
3. **Smaller circuits** (31, 32), better finalizers and majorants (33,
   34), and smaller tile languages and coefficient geometry (32, 34, 36).
4. **A smaller parent quartic.** It would lower every Jones and Sun degree
   (33, 34, 36). A new encoding of the first-index congruence (36).
5. **Justify the square base from the statement of `USys_of_mem`**, not its
   proof (34's open question 2; see the tension above).

Each package's full list is in its own article, for example
`33-signed16/report.tex` (from line 762), `34-integer14/report/synthesis_report.md`
(lines 1490-1503) and `32-integer15/report.tex` (from line 551).
