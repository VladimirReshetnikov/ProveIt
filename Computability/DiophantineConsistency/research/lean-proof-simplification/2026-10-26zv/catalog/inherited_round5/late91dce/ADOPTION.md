# Adoption record

How each proposal stands against the maintained tree `Computability/DiophantineConsistency/Lean`.
"Adopted" means the change is in the tree and the touched modules passed the
repository-pinned Lean compiler, through `lake build` or explicit
`lake env lean SOURCE -o OBJECT` checks. Validation scope is recorded separately.
Packet names refer to the subdirectories of this directory.

## Pending

| Proposal | Packet | Target | Note |
|---|---|---|---|
| guarded high-color fibers, `wang/proposals/boundary_fibers.patch` | o | `WangTiles942Boundary` | uncompiled proposal; claimed40 lines saved; retain high-color guard, initializer/reset colors and all seam tuples |

## Deferred or not adopted

| Proposal | Packet | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| `patches/conditional-padding.patch` | a | changes a theorem interface in `NativePreliminaryCount2011` / `CurrentCount2011`, which the research session is editing |
| `patches/modulus-reuse.patch` | a | `CurrentEarlyPadding2011` is being edited by the research session |
| `patches/representation-naturality.patch` | d | superseded by a's `assignment-map.patch` |
| `coefficient-refactoring.patch` | c | superseded by d's compiled version |
| `proposals/*.lean`, design-only sections | all | source-only demonstrations; revisit individually |

The PR-congruence proofs use `simp`: both `prec` constructor proofs now depend
on `[propext, Quot.sound]`. The old scalar proof was axiom-free; the old vector
proof used `[propext]`. These are standard axioms. Packet a's
`lean/RecursorCore.lean` gives an axiom-free generic congruence alternative.

The [26 October iteration review](../../reviews/lean-proof-simplification-20261026-root.md)
records the adopted changes above, exact checking scope, authorship and review.
Remaining pending proposals and deferrals retain their separately recorded
scope; compiler validation of adopted groups does not certify those proposals.

Commits `4de06108b3`, `2ed7cc3ebb`, `2924138249` and `4261a5e353` remove638
physical lines across six modules (1909 to1271), bringing the reviewed series
to2788 net lines removed. A separately checked147-line coefficient-proof
prototype was not adopted: it took170.32s and produced a4953664-byte object,
with longer source and a larger object than the adopted d candidate. These
individual build timings are not controlled performance comparisons.

The five continuation groups above remove228 net lines across21 files,
including both new helpers, bringing the reviewed source-reduction series
to3016 lines. `intake_e13` authored the bridge and specification ports,
`v_finite_full_static` the scanner port, and ROOT the norm/quadratic ports.
Independent exact-final source review passes for all five groups. Equation
artifacts are unchanged.

The degree certificates of `ShortSystem`, `ShortFrontier` and `ShortReducedStrong` were replaced
independently of these packets, by the `total_degree_bound` tactic in `TotalDegreeBound`.
