# Dyadic Sensitivity and Polynomial-Chaos Frontiers for the Fabius--Rvachev Law

This archive is the reproducible source package for a 34-page repository-aware
research report on a new orthogonal-chaos layer of the Fabius/Rvachev random
series.

## Main files

- `fabius_dyadic_chaos_frontiers.tex` - complete self-contained LaTeX source.
- `fabius_dyadic_chaos_frontiers.pdf` - compiled A4 report.
- `experiments.py` - deterministic, extensively commented exact and
  high-precision experiment driver.
- `requirements.txt` - Python dependencies.
- `data/` - generated CSV tables and the human-readable numerical summary.
- `figures/` - vector PDF and raster PNG versions of every generated figure.
- `audit/CORPUS_AUDIT.md` - recursive repository audit and nonduplication
  boundary.
- `audit/SOURCE_AUDIT.md` - source/literature roles and proof boundary.
- `audit/corpus_manifest_2026-08-27.txt` - preserved recursive TeX path ledger.
- `SHA256SUMS` - integrity hashes for all other files in the archive.

## Mathematical contribution map

The report starts from the established representation

```text
X = sum_{j>=1} 2^{-j} V_j,      V_j iid Uniform[-1,1],
M(t) = E exp(tX) = product_{j>=1} sinh(t/2^j)/(t/2^j).
```

It develops and proves:

1. exact Hoeffding/functional-ANOVA components of `exp(tX)`;
2. an independent Bernoulli active-digit law whose probabilities are
   `p(x)=1-tanh(x)/x`, giving every variance share and Sobol index;
3. a marked tensor-Legendre law with modified spherical-Bessel degree marks;
4. a general smooth-observable interaction bound with the exact dyadic
   q-Pochhammer factor;
5. sharp top-order formulas for monomials and finite Bell--Bernoulli component
   expressions;
6. a small-field Gaussian-q-binomial interaction law and its first correction;
7. a Mellin-derived logarithmic-periodic effective-dimension asymptotic;
8. a quantitative total-variation phase limit for the centered interaction
   order;
9. an exact transfer between the no-active atom and the negative Fabius Laplace
   product;
10. a Thue--Morse mixed-difference corner and a Lambert-W tensor-degree cutoff.

Conjectures and future directions cover phase-mode uniqueness, strict
log-concavity, differential transcendence, the full geometric-q phase diagram,
inverse-Fabius chaos, automatic signs, best N-term approximation, and Lean
formalization.

The novelty convention is repository-relative and is documented in `audit/`.
Classical ingredients are explicitly separated from new deductions.

## Reproduce the numerical files

From the archive root:

```bash
python experiments.py --root .
```

The program makes no network requests and uses no Monte Carlo sampling. It
regenerates every file under `data/` and `figures/`. Infinite products and sums
use explicit tail bounds; the chosen precision and checks are recorded in
`data/numerical_summary.txt`.

Minimum supported environment:

- Python 3.11 or newer;
- `mpmath>=1.3`;
- `numpy>=2.0`;
- `scipy>=1.13`;
- `matplotlib>=3.8`.

The supplied outputs were regenerated with Python 3.13.5, mpmath 1.3.0, NumPy
2.3.5, SciPy 1.17.0, and Matplotlib 3.10.8.

## Compile the report

A current TeX Live installation is sufficient. From the archive root, run:

```bash
latexmk -pdf -interaction=nonstopmode -halt-on-error \
  fabius_dyadic_chaos_frontiers.tex
```

Equivalently, run `pdflatex` repeatedly until the table of contents and cross
references stabilize. The supplied PDF was built with latexmk 4.86 and pdfTeX
1.40.26 (TeX Live 2025/dev). Standard packages are used, with Libertinus fonts
when available and Latin Modern as a fallback.

## Verification status

- All theorem, equation, figure, and bibliography references resolve.
- The final PDF has 34 A4 pages and embedded fonts.
- The PDF was preflighted and rendered page-by-page at 180 dpi.
- No clipping, overlapping text, broken glyphs, or black rendering artifacts
  were observed.
- The experiment outputs were regenerated from a fresh run before packaging.

## Integrity check

From the archive root:

```bash
sha256sum -c SHA256SUMS
```
