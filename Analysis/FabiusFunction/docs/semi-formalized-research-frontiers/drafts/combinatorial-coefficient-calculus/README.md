# combinatorial-coefficient-calculus

Canonical consolidation of six combinatorial coefficient-calculus and inversion
manuscripts received on 2026-09-01. Each arrival supplied one flat LaTeX/PDF
pair. The ZIP CRCs, member paths, and member types were checked before
extraction; at intake, the filed source and PDF bytes were identical to their
ZIP members.

**The consolidation is complete.** `Combinatorial_Coefficient_Calculus/` is the
single surviving package, and the five donor directories have been deleted now
that every source, topic, and claim row of the disposition ledger carries a
completed disposition. This was deliberately not a concatenation: 394 labels
occurred in more than one source, and the common material is retained once,
with the strongest correct hypotheses and one complete proof. A second proof
survives only where it exposes a different mechanism.

The consolidation boundary is recorded in
[`PROVENANCE.md`](Combinatorial_Coefficient_Calculus/PROVENANCE.md), the six
original sources and their immutable Git recovery locators in
[`SOURCE_INVENTORY.csv`](Combinatorial_Coefficient_Calculus/SOURCE_INVENTORY.csv),
and the topic/claim decisions in
[`SOURCE_DISPOSITION.csv`](Combinatorial_Coefficient_Calculus/SOURCE_DISPOSITION.csv).
The standard-library
[`validate_canonical.py`](Combinatorial_Coefficient_Calculus/validate_canonical.py)
checks LaTeX structure, labels, references, citations, proof pairing, exact
source coverage, Git object availability, and the one-publication layout;
run it with `--final`, which is the
mode this package is now expected to pass.

| Directory | Document |
| --- | --- |
| `Combinatorial_Coefficient_Calculus/` | **Canonical:** *Combinatorial Coefficient Calculus* — current source with a retained historical consolidation receipt for the 8,966-line, 390,732-byte source and the 174-page A4 PDF built from that source state |

At the consolidation checkpoint, the retained PDF rendered the then-filed TeX:
both came from the same three-pass `pdflatex` run, which reported no errors, no
undefined references, and no multiply-defined labels. The current TeX contains
later source-only editorial and Lean-crosswalk changes. The PDF was
intentionally not rebuilt for this overlay, so no present-source render parity,
current page count, or current source-size claim is made. The historical
receipts and closure evidence remain valid for their named source state.
Standalone checksum files are retired: provenance is kept in Git and
`SOURCE_INVENTORY.csv`, and the validator neither maintains nor requires file
digests.

## What the final merge changed

The last pass was driven by a label- and formula-level inventory of all six
sources rather than by reading order. Chapter `ch:merged-concordance`,
section "Closure of the merge", carries the in-document record. In summary:

- **The manuscript did not compile.** The shared-notation migration had left
  eight calls to catalogue macros whose expansion already ends in a script
  group followed directly by a prime or an exponent — for example
  `\TouchardPolynomial{n}'`, where the macro expands to
  `\mathsf{T}^{\mathrm{Tou}}_{n}`. Each is a fatal TeX "Double superscript"
  error.
- **A withdrawn claim became a theorem.** All six arrivals asserted
  `B_n < (0.792 n / log(n+1))^n` for every `n >= 1` without proving either the
  tail or the finite range, and the consolidation had demoted it to a remark.
  It is a theorem of Berend and Tassa (2010) and is now proved in both ranges:
  the tail from a new monotonicity lemma for the coefficient majorant, and
  `n <= 38` from the inequality between positive integers
  `B_n A_n^n < (792000 n)^n` with `A_n = ceil(10^6 log(n+1))`, which contains no
  irrational quantity at all.
- **An existing proof rested on an unstated fact.** The polygamma series were
  derived by logarithmically differentiating a Weierstrass product for
  `1/Gamma` that appeared nowhere else in the manuscript. Euler's limit and
  that product are now proved from the integral definition of `Gamma`, via the
  Beta integral.
- **Thirteen further donor-only results were merged**, each with a proof
  written for this text and each checked against an independent symbolic or
  exact-integer computation before insertion.
- **Notation was made uniform.** Around 180 further sites still spelled
  catalogue symbols by hand, including an italic imaginary unit next to an
  upright `e` inside one exponent. The document now follows
  `FabiusFunction_Mathematical_Notation_Catalogue` throughout.

## Current source-only Stirling overlay

The fixed-column second-kind Stirling theorem `thm:second-ogf` now separates
its formal-power-series content from scalar rational evaluation. Its
coefficient identity explicitly assumes `n >= k`; the formal proof identifies
two inverses of the same finite product, extracts the coefficient of the
finite product of geometric series, and then proves
`x^(k+1) * (1/x)↓(k+1) = ∏_{j=1}^k (1-jx)`. The falling-factorial spelling at
a scalar requires `x != 0`, and its reciprocal form also requires every
factor `1-jx` to be nonzero. The `k = 0`, `n = 0` empty-product case is
included.

The compiled zero-definition/eight-theorem
`StirlingCompleteHomogeneous.lean` surface contributes
`stirlingColumnOGF_eq_completeHomogeneousGeneratingSeriesOn`,
`stirlingSecond_add_eq_completeHomogeneousEvalOn`,
`stirlingSecond_eq_completeHomogeneousEvalOn_of_le`,
`stirlingSecond_add_eq_completeHomogeneousEval`,
`stirlingSecond_add_eq_eval_hsymm`, and
`stirlingSecond_add_eq_sum_finsuppAntidiag`. Its two companion declarations,
`pow_mul_descPochhammer_eval_inv_eq_prod_one_sub_natCast_mul` and
`prod_inv_one_sub_natCast_mul_eq_inv_pow_mul_descPochhammer_eval_inv`, cover
the scalar factorization and reciprocal spelling. Together they make
`thm:second-ogf` **Lean** with the corrected hypotheses. The retained PDF was
not rebuilt for this source-only overlay, so no PDF or checksum parity is
claimed for it.

## What this package does not claim

The manuscript is research-frontier mathematical writing. Its theorem and proof
environments are human-readable mathematics, not evidence of Lean verification.
The section "Lean formalization register" states, per result, what is formalized
and what is not; it is maintained separately from this consolidation.

## Weighted-transform checkpoint (2026-09-04)

The `AppellSequence` extension has passed a focused Lean build with
`LAKE_JOBS=1`: eleven public lemmas provide weighted binomial translation,
convolution transport, cancellation, and inversion. The manuscript gives their
complete human proofs and exact declaration crosswalks. Three private rational
helpers in `FinitePrefixThueMorseCollapse` were replaced by the shared API; that
caller refactor has been independently source-reviewed but awaits its own build.

The register contains 203 rows: 58 marked Lean, 34 partial, and 111 without a
Lean counterpart. The earlier classifications are inherited; this checkpoint
adds two compiler-backed entries and does not claim a fresh build of the whole
corpus. The final structural/provenance validator passes with 203 adjacent
proofs, 27 disposition records, and six original-source inventory rows. PDF
rebuilding remains deferred at the user's request.

The same-day upstream crosswalk connects the Bell normalization and unit-series
coefficient formulas to `UnitSeriesBellCoefficients`; its labelled-set partition
interpretation remains unformalized. That partial result is included in the
register totals above.
