# Spectra and arithmetic

New standalone intake members:
[`Fabius_Rvachev_Reciprocal_Integer_Convolution_Divisors/`](Fabius_Rvachev_Reciprocal_Integer_Convolution_Divisors/),
*Reciprocal-Integer Convolution Divisors of the Rvachev Law* (35 A4 pp,
2328 source lines; with a 352-line exact/numerical experiment),
arrived from a rootless 14-file archive on 2026-08-30.  The package's
characteristic quotients
`Q_M(z) = Phi(z) / Phi(z/M)` classify reciprocal-integer decompositions of
the Rvachev law.  Its digit IFS and multiplicative cocycle lead to an exact
odd-singular/even-regular trichotomy, transport and inverse-Fabius bounds,
an arithmetic zero divisor and spectral zeta function, and finite
Thue--Morse quotients whose `M = 3` case recovers Stern/hyperbinary
coefficients.

This is a distinct sibling of the shape/Stein report under
[`../representations/`](../representations/): unequal reciprocal-scale
factors here do not conflict with that report's obstruction to identical
convolution roots.  The report nevertheless shares foundational zero-count,
Bernoulli/Bell, endpoint, and inverse-Fabius infrastructure with the
consolidated corpus, so it remains separate pending a theorem-by-theorem
crosswalk. The rootless archive supplied no checksum ledger or dependency
lock; the repository-generated 14-entry `SHA256SUMS` covers every stored
payload after five CSV files were normalized to LF. The repair gives the
report a title-derived source/PDF pair and canonical A4/27 mm/Libertinus
styling; three final `pdflatex` passes produced a 35-page PDF with all fonts
embedded and subset, no Type 3 font, and no overfull box. Key pages and every
figure were inspected. A temp-isolated Python 3.12 replay regenerated every output: four
CSVs were byte-identical, the text summary was EOL-equivalent, and the endpoint
CSV had only 66 last-place differences (maximum `1.11e-16`).  All four PNGs
showed the expected layout drift between the unpinned packaged Matplotlib
3.10.8 and replayed 3.11.1 (1475 versus 1476 pixels wide), strengthening the
case for a dependency lock. The report cites the adjacent exact
`GeneralizedZeroDivisor` and `ReciprocalIntegerGammaZeros` APIs without
claiming that the quotient-family results themselves are formalized.
Manuscript theorem labels do not imply Lean proof status.

[`Fabius_Total_Positivity_Frontier_Report/`](Fabius_Total_Positivity_Frontier_Report/),
*Total Positivity and Cartwright Geometry in the Fabius--Rvachev Dyadic Sinc
Product* (24 pp), arrived as a bare TeX/PDF/script package on 2026-08-30.
Its imaginary-square-root transform, Laguerre--Polya and multiplier-sequence
structure, exact zero divisor and Thue--Morse sign interpolation, Cartwright
geometry, and geometric-scale deformation extend the arithmetic/spectral
Fourier-product theme. The package shipped no checksum ledger, README,
environment pin, or captured run output. The repository repair regenerated
the four required figure/table inputs and four CSV evidence tables, normalized
the source to A4/Libertinus, rebuilt the PDF in three passes, and added a live
12-entry payload ledger; exact arrival hashes remain recorded in the global
manifest.  The current source crosswalks the exact finite general-base digit
count in `BaseDigitMultiplicity.lean` without promoting the analytic zero or
sign claims. Its novelty screen is already stale at its pinned
snapshot: matching Laguerre--Polya/PF-infinity/shifted-Jensen and zero-sign
material appears in `Frontier_Compilations/`. It therefore remains standalone
pending claim-by-claim crosswalk and deliberate deduplication. Its paper
theorem labels do not by themselves assert Lean status.

Arithmetic and spectral structure of the Rvachev Fourier product,
consolidated (2026-08-28) into the single volume
[`Spectra_and_Arithmetic_Frontiers/`](Spectra_and_Arithmetic_Frontiers/):

- **Part I** — *Half-Integer Spectral Arithmetic*
  (formerly `Fabius_Half_Integer_Spectral_Frontier_Report/`);
- **Part II** — *Arithmetic Dyadic Rays of the Rvachev Fourier Product*
  (formerly `Fabius_Arithmetic_Rays_Frontier_Report/`);
- **Part III** — *Spectral Arithmetic and the Pascal–Rvachev Hierarchy*
  (formerly `Spectral_Arithmetic_Pascal_Rvachev_Hierarchy/`);
- **Part IV** — *Derivative Norm Spectra and Dual Moment Geometries of
  the Fabius–Rvachev System*
  (formerly `Fabius_Derivative_Norm_Spectrum_bundle/`, whose data,
  figures, and scripts live under `assets/`).

The member drafts were absorbed verbatim (labels, citation keys, and
asset paths mechanically prefixed per part; no mathematical content
altered) and their directories deleted; provenance with SHA-256 hashes
is recorded in the volume itself, and git history is the archive.

See [`../MANIFEST.md`](../MANIFEST.md) for titles and the previous paths.
