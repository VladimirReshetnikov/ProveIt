# q-Series and inverse q-analogs

This directory contains the one canonical document for forward q-series and
branch-aware inverse q-analog theory:
`q_pochhammer_q_binomial_monograph.tex`. Files under `chapters/` are implementation
units included by that master; they are not independent manuscripts.
The reader-facing structure has 28 numbered forward chapters, eight numbered
inverse chapters, and five appendices. The source-only validator's count of 13
chapter files refers to implementation inputs, not to the printed chapter
count.

The consolidation uses the former q-Pochhammer/q-binomial monograph as its
forward backbone and incorporates the former inverse-q synthesis as a
specialist part. The three general q-series guides were donor manuscripts:
their repeated results map to one strongest canonical statement, while only
genuinely stronger or independent material was transplanted. The completed
`source_concordance.csv` assigns every one of the 547 source result
environments a reviewed disposition. All five source-publication trees are
therefore historical inputs preserved by the pinned revision and repository
history, not parallel live packages.

The editorial contract is mathematical rather than mechanical:

- a repeated result is stated once, with the strongest proved hypotheses and
  one complete human-readable proof;
- an erroneous or overbroad assertion is corrected, split, or removed;
- an unproved assertion survives only when it is interesting, precise, and
  plausible, and then only in an explicitly labelled `Conjecture`
  environment;
- numerical and symbolic checks are evidence or regression tests, not
  substitutes for an infinite proof;
- exact Lean counterparts, partial Lean infrastructure, complete human proofs,
  source records, and conjectures are reported as distinct statuses.

## Provenance and reproducibility

`theorem_concordance.csv` and `audit/SOURCE_REVISION` retain the already
reviewed 260-row history of the six precursor inverse-q packages at commit
`6fe9fb8f50e1b8a9a800fa0e8ef6f688f5bb5838`. Those historical source paths
are immutable. `source_concordance.csv` is the completed 547-row disposition
ledger for the five-publication merge surface pinned by
`audit/MERGE_SOURCE_REVISION` at commit
`9560165ae2eb33590404a090ab26bd3ca715f32f`. The ledgers remain separate so
the earlier six-package inverse provenance is not silently reinterpreted.

The migrated `assets/` tree preserves six experiment programs, nineteen
CSV/TXT outputs, and fourteen vector figures selected by the historical
77-row `assets/ASSET_DISPOSITION.csv`. Its active `assets/SHA256SUMS` has 43
entries because it also covers asset metadata and environment files; this is
not a contradiction with the 39 retained historical payloads.

## Validation state

The source-structure gate is:

```text
python audit/validate_canonical.py
```

It checks the complete input graph, balanced environments, unique labels,
resolved references, immediate one-to-one ownership of a nonempty proof by
every proved result, both concordances---the 260-row inverse ledger and the
completed 547-row five-publication ledger---and reproduction of both pinned
source inventories.  Canonical status describes the destination, not the
donor's editorial disposition: a proved row with a live result destination
may never be marked `not applicable`, even when the donor copy was retired.
The larger ledger is reproduced, including all editorial columns, with

```text
python audit/extract_merge_sources.py
```

and may be regenerated explicitly with `--write-reviewed-csv`.  That write is
atomic, is tied to `audit/MERGE_SOURCE_REVISION`, and fails if any editorial
override does not match its pinned source exactly once.

The fifteen status-labelled archival identity records have a separate exact
finite check:

```text
python audit/verify_archival_identity_records.py
```

It compares all coefficients through degree 100 using integer arithmetic:
1,515 equalities in total. This is a transcription-quality gate, explicitly
not an infinite proof of any recorded identity.

The exhaustive package checksum gate is:

```text
python audit/build_package_checksums.py --check
```

It checks every permanent package file except the self-referential root
`SHA256SUMS` ledger itself. The nested asset ledger remains independently
useful because it preserves the migrated experiment and research-figure
boundary.

The retained `q_pochhammer_q_binomial_monograph.pdf` is a 348-page A4
historical build of the immediately preceding master source (14,158 lines,
661,835 bytes,
SHA-256 `79ee5e60a6c7e42a91c58dcd9bcae56173cc6b4aa3e54739a461943f705f3904`).
The PDF is 3,002,729 bytes with SHA-256
`8bf14b52d8a0fc0abc4d54cca503fd47a2df37cf76ee1bb4e442bea1fd2a4aa7`.
It was produced by exactly three serial
`pdflatex -interaction=nonstopmode -halt-on-error` passes, which produced 338,
348, and 348 pages, with `makeindex` run on the `.idx` file after each pass.
The final log scan found three overfull boxes, all in the single paragraph of the QPochhammerEntire crosswalk (source lines 652--670) whose long declaration names lack break points. All pages are A4. `pdffonts` reports 42 font rows, all
embedded and subsetted, including 5 Libertinus rows, with no Type-3
fonts. The files under `assets/experiments/**/figures/` remain research
figures, not publication manuscripts.

The current master TeX is a source-only successor to that checkpoint. Its
14,325-line, 671,679-byte source has SHA-256
`a059f3766b3ad25184b27d189a86dd7a56eec4acdd24d7d390c8784d0389474a`.
It includes exhaustive crosswalks for `QPochhammerEntire` (zero definitions
and five legacy compatibility theorems), `QPochhammerInfinite` (one definition
and twenty-nine theorems), `QPochhammerDissection` (zero definitions and two
theorems), `QBinomialTheoremInfinite` (one definition and twenty-two
theorems), `GaussianBinomialPalindromic` (zero definitions and fourteen
theorems), `GaussianBinomialPolynomialStructure` (zero definitions and five
theorems), and `GeometricPochhammerNormalConvergence` (zero
definitions and three theorems). The newer inventory also includes
`QMultinomial` (one definition and nine theorems),
`QPochhammerInfiniteBounds` (five theorems), `QPochhammerComplexOrder` (one
definition and four theorems), `BasicHypergeometricSeries` (two definitions
and five theorems), `HeineTransformation` (two definitions and five theorems),
and `QGaussSummation` (two theorems), as well as expanded Euler, Jacobi, and
Rogers--Szegő material. The latest inventory adds
`GaussianBinomialPalindromic` (fourteen theorems), `QExponential` (three
definitions and eight theorems), `JacksonIntegral` (one definition and seven
theorems), `ThetaQuasiPeriodicity` (one definition and six theorems),
`QPochhammerLogDerivative` (ten theorems),
`QPochhammerOrderDerivative` (three theorems), and `JacobiCubic` (two
theorems). The current tail adds `CentralQBinomialReduction` (six theorems)
and `CyclotomicFactorization` (seven theorems).
The two newest generic theorems are
`deriv_qPochhammerInfIn_ne_zero_of_mul_pow_eq_one`, which gives a nonzero
derivative at every raw factor zero `a*q^j = 1` including `q = 0`, and
`analyticOrderAt_qPochhammerInfIn_of_eq_zero`, which gives analytic order
exactly one at every zero. The `QPochhammerEntire` wrappers retain the older
`complexQPochhammerInf` names by transferring the generic local-uniformity,
entireness, zero-locus, reciprocal-power, and analytic-order results rather
than duplicating their analytic proofs. In `QBinomialTheoremInfinite`,
`finiteQPochhammerIn_zero_left` remains the unique declaration owned by
`GaussianBinomialAtOne` and is imported rather than redeclared. The forward
status ledger is 73 Exact, 84 Partial, 117 None, and 8 interface rows; the
original 191-result pre-Fabius core is 36/29/123/3, and the
q-integer/Gaussian chapter is 8/1/0/0. The completed source concordance records
66 Lean-proved rows, 412 human-proved frontier rows, 60 not-applicable rows,
and 9 conjectures.
The fourteen-theorem `GaussianBinomialPalindromic` API and five-theorem
`GaussianBinomialPolynomialStructure` API give exact degree,
monicity, constant and top coefficients, reflection, coefficient
palindromicity, and the division-free mean identity over generic commutative
semirings. Its new `coeff_gaussianBinomial_one_of_pos_of_lt` and
`coeff_gaussianBinomial_one` theorems prove the strict-interior coefficient
of `q` is one and give the total formula with every boundary zero. Thus
`cor:positivity`, `thm:qbinom-structure`, and the inverse-source proposition
`prop:gq-positive-palindromic` are Exact. The compound
outer spectral-product theorem remains Partial even though the three-theorem
outer-product leaf proves local-uniform (normal) convergence for every complex
strict contraction, including `q = 0`, together with the nome-`1/4` Rvachev
and bounded-Fabius Fourier specializations. Its named centered/MGF packaging,
exterior reciprocal formula, pole divisor, and zero--pole exchange remain
outside Lean.
The new status changes record the exact q-exponential eigenfunction and
Jackson integration-by-parts subclaims, and Partial formalizations of the
q-exponential factorization, Jackson fundamental theorem, and theta
quasi-periodicity; the remaining clauses named in their rows stay explicit.
The incoming tail further makes the full elementary Gaussian-polynomial
structure and Jacobi's cubic identity Exact, while adding Partial order
derivative and Gaussian-moment rows; the Lambert logarithm row remains
Partial with both displayed derivative formulas now formalized.
The central-reduction row is now Exact through a division-free commutative-ring
identity and its field quotient wrapper; the cyclotomic-factorization row is
Exact over every commutative ring for the factorial form and every integral
domain for the Gaussian form, with the exponent bounds stated explicitly.

The retained PDF and its named checkpoint source were synchronized by that
build. The current source now postdates the checkpoint, and the root package
checksum ledger (`SHA256SUMS`) records the actual hashes of both. No PDF was
generated locally while resolving this merge; the 348-page PDF remains a
historical, source-pinned artifact until the next synchronized guarded build.
