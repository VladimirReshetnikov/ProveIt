# Series and transseries

Everything in this group is now one document.

The authoritative live Lean inventory and zero-gap result are computed by
`scripts/doc_audit.py` and pinned in `docs/doc_audit_baseline.json`; the
970/12,051 and 967/12,001 inventories are historical checkpoints.
The flatness module now includes both its vector-valued API and the scalar
submodule, absorption, and inverse-power-scale interfaces (4 definitions and
22 theorems). The differential-block module contains one definition and 20
theorems.

The new Bell derivation-tower and ordinary-Bell normalization results have
exact source counterparts. The Touchard definitions and coefficient identities
are also formalized. The arbitrary-power coefficient recurrence is now exact
through a generic commutative-ring differential equation and a unit-series
rational-algebra instance. The displayed Touchard Euler-operator equation is
exact as well. The wider Wright-omega, differential-closure, harmonic,
Cayley, derangement, Lambert-correction, core-inversion, remainder-transport,
and staircase statements still have the qualifications recorded in the source;
the least-term-index lemmas are supporting results, not a complete
optimal-truncation theorem.

## What was merged

Forty-two independently written articles, filed between 1 and 3 September
2026, in five groups. Thirty of them had already been consolidated once, into
two volumes; those two and the remaining twelve articles are now a single
volume, and all five source directories have been deleted. Git history is the
archive, and the volume's provenance appendix lists every source with the part
that absorbed it.

| Group | Articles | Absorbed as |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `transseries-tutorials/` | 4 | Part I, Orientation |
| `polynomial-logarithmic-transseries/` | 6 | the calculus parts |
| `special-function-inversion/` | 24 | the inversion parts |
| `lambert-inverse-transseries/` | 3 | reversing `x + W(x)` |
| `sequence-transseries/` | 5 | the Bell and Fubini chapters |

## The comparison this group had left open

The previous version of this README recorded, as explicitly unmade, the
comparison between the polynomial–logarithmic calculus and the inversion
calculi that the special-function and Lambert-inverse articles each extract.
The merge makes it, and the volume's concordance chapter states it pair by
pair.

The result is **less overlap than a title-level comparison suggests**. Of six
apparent overlaps, one is a genuine duplicate (the exponential partial Bell
polynomials, the same definition in two notations), one is a strengthening in
the inversion apparatus's favour (a two-sided residual bracket with a
root-existence certificate, now machine-checked as
`Fabius.exists_eq_in_residual_interval`, against a one-sided mean-value bound),
one item has no counterpart at all (the ordinary Bell family), and three are
different theorems about the same subject — most notably the two results both called
Lagrange–Bürmann, which are the near-identity *operator* form and the classical
*coefficient* form, neither implying the other without a genuine argument.

Shared vocabulary turned out to be a weak signal, and an intermediate stage of
this merge was misled by it; the volume records the correction rather than
quietly fixing it.

The source also carries a statement-level Lean crosswalk for the abstract
asymptotic-scale and Poincaré-expansion core, flatness and invisible functions,
the Hahn-series order foundations, polynomial--logarithmic height estimates,
Wright omega, differential-block integration, staircase inversion, and
residual/error transport. These scoped matches do not turn unrelated human
proofs or frontier statements into Lean results.

What the inversion apparatus genuinely adds over the calculus is the
exponential–power model and its axiomatized dominant core, the monomial
α-reduction, perturbed inversion around an exactly invertible core, the
two-sided backward-error certificate, and — with no analogue anywhere in the
calculus — the theory of inverting a **sequence**: three distinct inverse
objects, the staircase theorem, and the separation condition under which an
asymptotic inverse determines an integer one. The calculus is a theory of
functions on a scale; that last group is about the passage to a sequence.

## Lean crosswalk

The current corpus census and zero-gap result are maintained by
`scripts/doc_audit.py` and `docs/doc_audit_baseline.json`. Thirty-five
focused modules contain 304 explicit public commands; two named declarations
generated by `to_additive` bring that inventory to 306 named entries. Fourteen
of the first fifteen incoming leaves are directly relevant here; the later
Stirling, Wright-omega two-orders, and unit-series power leaves are also focused.
`TransseriesWellBased.lean` contributes seven written declarations plus its two
generated additive twins, and `WrightOmega.lean` contributes one definition
and thirteen theorems. `TransseriesMonomialUniqueness.lean` now has four
theorems, adding `tendsto_const_mul_plMonomial_div_one_iff` and
`isEquivalent_const_mul_plMonomial_iff` to its two compatibility wrappers.
The new `TransseriesWrightOmegaTerms.lean` leaf has ten theorems:
`plMonomial_one_zero_eventuallyEq`, `plMonomial_zero_one_eventuallyEq`,
`plMonomial_neg_one_one_eventuallyEq`, `exponents_of_wrightOmega`,
`exponents_of_wrightOmega_sub`, `exponents_of_wrightOmega_residual`,
`not_pure_of_wrightOmega_three_terms`,
`not_isEquivalent_pure_power_wrightOmega_sub`,
`tendsto_wrightOmega_div_plMonomial_zero_atTop`, and
`isLittleO_wrightOmega_residual_plMonomial_zero`. They now crosswalk the
following parts of this volume:

- Exact: the sequence-scale/Poincaré definitions, coefficient limits and
  uniqueness; flatness and the invisible-function proposition; Dickson's
  lemma; Neumann's lemma through literal `OrderDual` wrappers (the manuscript's
  total order is a specialization); the analytic power–log dominance
  trichotomy; the logarithmic block-class equivalence;
  `plt:prop:mot-omega-basic` over the reals only; the unique first three
  Wright-omega monomial terms and the real-`atTop` content of
  `plt:cor:mot-both-generators-needed` and
  `plt:prop:mot-one-generator-fails`; the abstract Bell derivation
  recurrence; the
  ordinary/exponential partial-Bell normalization; `p0:lem:bell-conversion`,
  `p0:lem:power-log`, and `p0:cor:exp-log-jets`; the integer block derivative
  equations `plt:eq:mot-block-derivative` and `plt:eq:dif-block` for a unit
  power generator; and `p6:prop:quadratic-core-catalan`.
- Partial with an explicit boundary: the two displayed height estimates are
  exact but the general nested height/depth prose has no datatype; the
  harmonic-increment theorem has only its leading term; the compound
  `plt:lem:mot-block-antiderivative` and `plt:prop:dif-block` remain without
  the concrete Laurent-series ambient and remaining faithful-evaluation and
  uniqueness links even though their integer equations and conditional
  nonresonant primitive API are exact; the real
  linear–log and `r = 1` power–log cores omit their asymptotic, complex, and
  general-`r` clauses; remainder transport includes its displayed explicit
  error law but omits the closing asymptotic clause; the three abstract
  differential-minimality assertions are exact but the concrete germ growth
  and algebraic-independence clauses are not; both concluding Wright-omega
  equivalences are exact, but the four-term quantitative expansion and an
  abstract transseries-scale construction are not packaged;
  staircase inversion omits the Fourier/interpolation layer; the nearest-
  integer theorem omits its real-argument and branch-family claims; and the
  quadratic coefficient recurrence is checked without the assembled square-
  root/deepest-pole construction.

The focused module/count inventory and per-result caveats are in the package
README and adjacent “Formal crosswalk” remarks in the canonical TeX.

## Residue audit

Deletion followed an audit of the twelve newly merged sources against the
assembled volume, and of the two consolidated volumes by direct containment.
The two volumes are absorbed verbatim: 32 of 32,874 substantive lines of the
calculus and 4 of 14,980 of the inversion volume differ, and every difference
is a transformation made deliberately at assembly — the sectioning shift, with
its 49 consequent "this section" → "this chapter" rewrites, and three retitled
chapters.

For the twelve articles, matching every named result against the volume's 768
titled results left six with no close counterpart; all six were checked
individually and are covered under other names, are alternative derivations of
a theorem the volume does state (a Lipschitz–Poisson route and a
Bose–Einstein-kernel route to the same pole expansion), or were demoted on
purpose. The audit's first pass left ten such results, and the four that were
genuinely missing — the saddle-localization lemma, the certified pole-tail
bounds, the linear pole budget, and the weighted Fubini polynomials — were
absorbed before deleting. Numeric residue is sequence values, numerical-table
mantissas and worked-example integers, none of them a result.
