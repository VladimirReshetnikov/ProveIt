# Documentation audit

`AGENTS.md` lists two documentation invariants for
`Analysis/FabiusFunction/Lean`:

- every source file carries a `/-! ... -/` module header; and
- every non-`private` declaration carries a `/-- ... -/` doc comment.

Neither held corpus-wide when this audit was first run.  This file records the
gap, and
[`scripts/doc_audit.py`](../scripts/doc_audit.py) makes it measurable, so that
a reviewer can check a change did not make it worse rather than re-deriving
the numbers by hand.  `AGENTS.md` asks for exactly this: a recorded, executable
scan rather than a number quoted from a vanished shell session.

## Running it

From the repository root:

```sh
python3 Analysis/FabiusFunction/scripts/doc_audit.py
python3 Analysis/FabiusFunction/scripts/doc_audit.py --list
```

The first form prints the totals and the twenty worst files.  The second adds
every undocumented declaration as `file:line  name`, which is the form to use
when clearing one file.

To use it as a gate:

```sh
python3 Analysis/FabiusFunction/scripts/doc_audit.py \
  --baseline Analysis/FabiusFunction/docs/doc_audit_baseline.json
```

This exits non-zero if the missing-doc total rises, if any individual file gets
worse, if a new file appears without a module header, or if the corpus inventory
changes without a reviewed baseline refresh.  The ratchet was originally
needed to make progress against a large inherited backlog.  As of 2026-08-29
that backlog is zero, so the checked baseline now enforces both invariants
without an exception.

Refresh the baseline with `--write-baseline` after genuinely reducing the
missing-doc count or after verifying a fully documented corpus addition.

## What the script does and does not check

It is a lexical scan, not Lean elaboration.  It tracks nested `/- -/` blocks,
`/-- -/` doc comments, `/-! -/` module comments, string literals and `--` line
comments, so a declaration keyword appearing inside a comment or a string is
never counted.  It accepts an attribute line (`@[simp]`, a multi-line
`@[...]`), an attribute on the same line as its declaration
(`@[simp] theorem foo`), a `set_option ... in` line, or blank lines between a
doc comment and the declaration it documents.  It also accepts the one-line
`/-- ... -/ theorem foo` form.

It does not see declarations produced by macros.  A `to_additive`-generated
name is invisible to it, exactly as it is to a reader of the source, so a
generated declaration is neither counted as present nor reported as
undocumented.

It says nothing about whether a doc comment is *correct*.  That is the more
expensive audit, and three defects it would have caught are recorded below.

## Findings

### Module headers

Twelve modules had no `/-! ... -/` header at all, verified by direct grep
(`/-!` occurring zero times in the file):

`PeriodicFourier`, `PeriodicMean`, `HalfQBinomial`, `ThueMorseGenerating`,
`ThueMorsePrefix`, `FabiusSaddleCentral`, `SaddleAllOrders`,
`FabiusSaddleExponentAllOrders`, `FabiusSaddleTailAllOrders`,
`FabiusSaddleReferenceTail`, `NegativeLaplaceVerticalOrdinaryJets`,
`GammaSecondOrder`.

Four more had a bare title with at most one line of prose, and one of those
described finished, downstream-consumed results as scratch development:

`FabiusLambertDerivativeBounds`, `FabiusSaddleCentralLambert`,
`NegativeLaplaceVerticalTaylor`, `NegativeLaplaceVerticalFourthBound`.

`SaddleLogExpansionAlgebra` called itself a scratch module in an otherwise
accurate header.

All of these have been written or rewritten.  Every header was drafted against
the whole file and then checked by a second reader against the same file,
because a header that is trusted and wrong is worse than one that is absent.

`PeriodicFourier` is the case that mattered most: 72 public declarations, the
entire Mellin and Fourier analysis of the regularized Bose kernel, and no
statement anywhere in the file of what it was for.

### Doc comments

The backlog began at 862 undocumented public declarations, 31% of the corpus.
Two documentation waves and a pass over the two root modules first brought it
to 176, or 6.2%, and the original 191-module corpus was subsequently cleared
according to the then-current checker.

That apparent zero exposed a checker defect: declarations written as
`@[simp] theorem foo` on one line were not counted at all.  After teaching the
auditor to remove balanced leading attribute blocks, and after the corpus grew
to 311 modules, the corrected 2026-08-27 inventory initially contained 4,803
public declarations with 105 missing comments in 40 files.  The old parser saw
only 4,606 declarations and
36 gaps on those same bytes; the correction therefore recovered 197 attributed
declarations, including 69 undocumented ones.  Run the script for the live
numbers rather than copying these historical values.

The post-merge 2026-08-30 inventory contains 601 modules and 8,189 lexically
visible public declarations, with zero missing module headers and zero missing
doc comments.  The baseline records those zeroes, so every future source
addition must preserve the full invariant rather than merely avoid worsening a
historical backlog.

### What the review pass caught

Both waves paired each documenting agent with an independent auditor, and that
was not ceremony.  The recurring defect was never a wrong formula -- it was a
false claim about dependencies: "every coefficient computation below factors
through this" when one does not, "the denominator in every ratio bound here"
when it is the denominator of one, "used by X" when X re-derives it inline.
Prose asserting a dependency is much easier to get wrong than prose asserting a
statement, because the statement is on the next line and the dependency is not.

Two doc comments had silently dropped an ambient `IsFabius F`; one stated its
two interval inclusions in the wrong directions; one said an interval
restriction was necessary when the file proves no converse.

The second wave was told this in advance and instructed to write no "used by"
clause at all unless it had been grepped.  78 verified consumer clauses came
out of that, and the defect rate fell accordingly.

### Doc comments that contradicted their statements

A separate sampling pass read about 190 doc-comment/statement pairs looking
for prose that claims more, or less, than the Lean statement.  The corpus is in
good shape here; three defects were found and fixed.

1. `norm_iteratedDeriv_negativeLaplaceVerticalKernelLogFirst_le` was documented
   as holding "uniformly on every vertical strip center `|theta| <= 1`".  Its
   statement has no such hypothesis: `theta` is an arbitrary real and the
   constant does not mention it.  The prose *understated* the theorem, which
   would have sent a reader looking elsewhere for a bound this lemma already
   gives.

2. and 3. `legendrePolynomial_contDiff` and
   `contDiff_negativeLaplaceVerticalCurve` assert `ContDiff R (top)` with the
   exponent elaborated at `WithTop ℕ∞`.  In this Mathlib that is the *analytic*
   exponent `ω`, not `C^∞`:

   ```text
   Mathlib/Analysis/Calculus/ContDiff/FTaylorSeries.lean:118
     scoped[ContDiff] notation3 "ω" => (⊤ : WithTop ℕ∞)
   Mathlib/Analysis/Calculus/ContDiff/FTaylorSeries.lean:120
     scoped[ContDiff] notation3 "∞" => ((⊤ : ℕ∞) : WithTop ℕ∞)
   ```

   Both were documented as merely "smooth".  The corpus writes `ContDiff ℝ ∞`
   in 66 places and `ContDiff ℝ ⊤` in only these two, so the distinction is
   deliberate everywhere else.

   This distinction is worth policing in this corpus in particular.  Its
   central regularity result is that the Fabius function is `C^∞` everywhere
   and analytic exactly off `[0,1]`; a doc comment that says "smooth" over an
   `ω` statement is the one confusion the library exists to prevent.

## Suggested order of work

1. Any new file: header and doc comments at the time of writing.  The ratchet
   gate makes this cheap to enforce.
2. The five worst files.  Clearing them removes about a quarter of the
   backlog.
3. Doc comments on public declarations that appear in `PAPER_COVERAGE.md`,
   since those are the ones an outside reader reaches first.
4. The long interior estimate chains, one module at a time, ideally by the
   agent that most recently worked in the module and still has its structure
   in mind.

Adding a doc comment cannot change elaboration, so this work needs no build
slot.  On a machine where a full rebuild costs the better part of a day, that
makes it unusually good value.
