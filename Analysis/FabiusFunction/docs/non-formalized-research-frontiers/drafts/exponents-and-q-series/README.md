# Exponents and q-series

Generalizations of the dyadic construction to arbitrary exponent
sequences and the q-series calculus that organizes them: the
exponent-sequence convolution monoid with its Newton-basis frontiers, and
q-binomial Richardson acceleration of geometric sinc products. The
denominator-free Gaussian/q-binomial core used by both is formalized at arbitrary
ratio. The normalized geometric-Lagrange and analytic Lagrange layers additionally
assume injectivity of `j |-> q^j` on the finite node set (see the status boxes and
crosswalk paragraphs inside the documents). `AnalyticSeriesFilter.lean` carries the core to exact
diagonal and Gaussian-tail identities for unconditionally summable sampled
series. Its hypotheses are sharp at zero-weight nodes, but it does not cover
conditionally convergent boundary series, uniform estimates, signs or bounds,
or the concrete sinc-product/Bell-series instantiation.

The documents also cross-reference the independent real fractional-Volterra
layer. `FractionalVolterraCalculus.lean` proves positive affine covariance on
ordered intervals for arbitrary real order. For `alpha <= 0`, this covariance is
an identity for the totalized Lean interval-integral definition; a classical
Riemann--Liouville/integrability interpretation is asserted only for positive
order. Gamma-normalized order raising holds for real `alpha > 0` from a continuous Banach-valued primitive with an
interval-integrable right derivative. `FabiusFractionalVolterra.lean`
specializes this to the signed Fabius extension for `x >= 0`, the bounded
Fabius function for `0 <= x <= 1`, and the Up-to-Fabius bridge for `x >= -1`.
Complex orders, Caputo/Riemann--Liouville derivatives, weighted-monomial or iterated
shifts, negative-branch and hierarchy formulas, and inverse/quantile versions
remain research frontiers. These API claims were checked at source checkpoint
`22f801337`.

Member: `Exponents_and_q_Series_Frontiers` (97 pp, four parts) — the
2026-08-28 consolidation of the two former drafts (Part I:
Newton-basis frontiers; Part II: q-binomial Richardson), joined the
same day by the eighth-wave report as **Part III** — *Finite Dyadic
Sinc Products and Piecewise-Polynomial Approximants to Rvachev's
Up-Function* (formerly `finite_sinc_products_report/`): the exact
truncated-power formula for the prefix densities `p_n` with signed
Thue–Morse top-derivative jumps on a uniform dyadic knot grid, sharp
derivative plateaux, the exact error law
`||p_n^(r) − up^(r)||_∞ = 2^(C(r+3,2)−1)/(9·4^n)` with exact
Kolmogorov distance `1/(9·4^n)`, the Bell–Bernoulli all-orders
expansion, stable `q = 1/4` Richardson weights in closed q-binomial
form (extending Part II), a uniform scale-mixture representation
`X = R·U` of the up law, and a positive Gauss/Radau/Lobatto tail
quadrature hierarchy with exact constants — including the
variance-matched positive `16^{-n}` scheme that the frontier corpus
had proposed without construction, and a sixth-order exact-support
Radau rule — and by the two ninth-wave same-topic reports, **merged
editorially** (shared core stated once, constants cross-checked,
unique layers of each kept) as **Part IV** — *Fourier Images of the
Repeated-Integration Approximants* (formerly
`Rvachev_Piecewise_Approximation_Fourier_Images/` and
`rvachev_fourier_frontier_report/`): the master factorization
`f̂_n = Φ · A(2^{-n} t)` with the universal tail-transfer function
`A = sinc z / Φ(z)`, its cotangent and valuation-weighted canonical
products with signed divisor `1 − v₂(m)`, digit-sum zero counts and
the Thue–Morse sign law, exact Taylor radius `4π` with dominant-pole
coefficient asymptotics and an arithmetic Darboux hierarchy, the
complete finite/limit zero-multiplicity filtration, the sharp
`o(2^n)` relative-convergence window with forward/inverse
conditioning thresholds at `4π·2^n` and `π·2^n`, the impossibility of
globally stable convolutional deconvolution, weighted-`L^p` and
Sobolev all-orders norm laws with explicit leading constants, exact
algebraic mean-square Fourier tails with the sharp threshold
`f_n ∈ H^s ⟺ s < n + 1/2`, and positive moment-matched atomic,
dyadic-atomic, and polynomial-density closure menus at rates
`16^{-n}`–`256^{-n}`, compared as a family against Part III's box
mixtures.  The eighth-wave fold also repaired the volume's
part-boundary section numbering (Part II had rendered with
`\appendix` letters G–N).  Supporting files under `assets/`,
provenance with SHA-256 in the document itself.
