# Exponents and q-series

Generalizations of the dyadic construction to arbitrary exponent
sequences and the q-series calculus that organizes them: the
exponent-sequence convolution monoid with its Newton-basis frontiers, and
q-binomial Richardson acceleration of geometric sinc products. The
denominator-free Gaussian/q-binomial core used by both is formalized at arbitrary
ratio. The normalized geometric-Lagrange and analytic Lagrange layers additionally
assume injectivity of `j |-> q^j` on the finite node set (see the status boxes and
crosswalk paragraphs inside the documents). `AnalyticSeriesFilter.lean` carries the core to exact
diagonal and Gaussian-tail identities for unconditionally summable sampled
series. Its hypotheses are sharp at zero-weight nodes, but it does not cover
conditionally convergent boundary series, uniform estimates, signs or bounds,
or the concrete sinc-product/Bell-series instantiation.

The documents also cross-reference the independent real fractional-Volterra
layer. `FractionalVolterraCalculus.lean` proves positive affine covariance on
ordered intervals for arbitrary real order. For `alpha <= 0`, this covariance is
an identity for the totalized Lean interval-integral definition; a classical
Riemann--Liouville/integrability interpretation is asserted only for positive
order. Gamma-normalized order raising holds for real `alpha > 0` from a continuous Banach-valued primitive with an
interval-integrable right derivative. `FabiusFractionalVolterra.lean`
specializes this to the signed Fabius extension for `x >= 0`, the bounded
Fabius function for `0 <= x <= 1`, and the Up-to-Fabius bridge for `x >= -1`.
Complex orders, Caputo/Riemann--Liouville derivatives, weighted-monomial or iterated
shifts, negative-branch and hierarchy formulas, and inverse/quantile versions
remain research frontiers. These API claims were checked at source checkpoint
`22f801337`.

Member: `Exponents_and_q_Series_Frontiers` (80 pp, three parts) — the
2026-08-28 consolidation of the two former drafts (Part I:
Newton-basis frontiers; Part II: q-binomial Richardson), joined the
same day by the eighth-wave report as **Part III** — *Finite Dyadic
Sinc Products and Piecewise-Polynomial Approximants to Rvachev's
Up-Function* (formerly `finite_sinc_products_report/`): the exact
truncated-power formula for the prefix densities `p_n` with signed
Thue–Morse top-derivative jumps on a uniform dyadic knot grid, sharp
derivative plateaux, the exact error law
`||p_n^(r) − up^(r)||_∞ = 2^(C(r+3,2)−1)/(9·4^n)` with exact
Kolmogorov distance `1/(9·4^n)`, the Bell–Bernoulli all-orders
expansion, stable `q = 1/4` Richardson weights in closed q-binomial
form (extending Part II), a uniform scale-mixture representation
`X = R·U` of the up law, and a positive Gauss/Radau/Lobatto tail
quadrature hierarchy with exact constants — including the
variance-matched positive `16^{-n}` scheme that the frontier corpus
had proposed without construction, and a sixth-order exact-support
Radau rule.  The fold also repaired the volume's part-boundary
section numbering (Part II had rendered with `\appendix` letters
G–N).  Supporting files under `assets/`, provenance with SHA-256 in
the document itself.
