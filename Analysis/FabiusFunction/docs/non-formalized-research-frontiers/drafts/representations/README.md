# Representations

Series and orthogonal-expansion representations of the up-function,
consolidated (2026-08-28) into the single volume
[`Representation_Frontiers/`](Representation_Frontiers/) (109 pp):

- **Part I** — *Resolvent, Continued-Fraction, and Transform
  Representations of the Fabius–Rvachev System* (Jacobi coefficients,
  exact even moments, resolvent and logarithmic-derivative identities;
  formerly
  `Fabius_Rvachev_Representation_Frontiers/`);
- **Part II** — *Representation Atlas and New Analytic Bridges for the
  Fabius Function, Rvachev's Up-Function, and Their Fourier Images*
  (formerly `fabius_rvachev_representation_frontier/`);
- **Part III** — *Dyadic Multiresolution and Product–Series
  Representations* (rational mass arrays, Haar–Schauder expansions,
  Walsh–Thue–Morse products, beta-mixture limits, Bell–Bernoulli scale
  energies, inverse-quantile duality; formerly
  `Fabius_Rvachev_Multiresolution_Report/`).

(The random-variable representation is formalized in
`ProbabilityRepresentation.lean`, and `RandomSeriesLaw.lean` identifies the
unit-interval law with the affine image of the up measure.
`CauchyTransform.lean` defines the report-sign Cauchy--Stieltjes transforms and
proves their measure forms, the up-density form, holomorphy off the named interval cuts,
first-derivative kernel formulas, and the affine bridge
`S(z) = 2 R(2z - 1)`.  `AffineDifferenceOrbit.lean` formalizes the reusable
conditional all-order passage.  The logarithmic fixed point, the one-step
resolvent DDE, and hence its measure-specific Thue--Morse orbit and kernel
identity remain open.)

The reciprocal-Gamma portion of Part II is now formal at source checkpoint
`71ab6f6728fceb753c88d8b0573077a59acf2682`.  The reusable convergence engine
is `ScaledInfiniteProducts.lean`; `GeometricReciprocalGamma.lean` constructs
the entire product
`G_q(z) = product_n Gamma(1 + q^n z)^(-1)` for complex `q` with `‖q‖ < 1`,
proves its Mahler equation, zero orbit, reflection, and dyadic Rvachev bridge;
and `DyadicGammaOrder.lean` proves the exact negative-integer zero set and
dyadic zero/pole orders.  The Gamma-side functions are totalized pointwise
inverses, with poles recorded by negative meromorphic order.  Still open are
the raw Gamma tprod away from its poles, arithmetic canonical regrouping,
logarithmic/digamma/Malmsten/heat/integral identities, D-finiteness,
general-base pole orders, and the reciprocal-Gamma derivative coefficient
needed by the separate Thue--Morse tower.

The mathematical bodies of the member drafts were preserved (labels,
citation keys, and asset paths were mechanically prefixed per part),
with top-level counters and reproduction instructions adapted to the
consolidated layout. Their standalone TeX/PDF pairs were deleted;
provenance with SHA-256 hashes is recorded in the volume itself, and git
history is the archive. Reproducibility files remain under the volume's
`assets/` directory, with each former package's README updated for its
new location.

See [`../MANIFEST.md`](../MANIFEST.md) for titles and provenance.
