# Representations

Series and orthogonal-expansion representations of the up-function,
consolidated (2026-08-28) into the single volume
[`Representation_Frontiers/`](Representation_Frontiers/) (110 pp):

- **Part I** — *Resolvent, Continued-Fraction, and Transform
  Representations of the Fabius–Rvachev System* (Jacobi coefficients,
  exact even moments, resolvent and logarithmic-derivative identities;
  formerly
  `Fabius_Rvachev_Representation_Frontiers/`);
- **Part II** — *Representation Atlas and New Analytic Bridges for the
  Fabius Function, Rvachev's Up-Function, and Their Fourier Images*
  (formerly `fabius_rvachev_representation_frontier/`);
- **Part III** — *Dyadic Multiresolution and Product–Series
  Representations* (rational mass arrays, Haar–Schauder expansions,
  Walsh–Thue–Morse products, beta-mixture limits, Bell–Bernoulli scale
  energies, inverse-quantile duality; formerly
  `Fabius_Rvachev_Multiresolution_Report/`).

(The random-variable representation is formalized in
`ProbabilityRepresentation.lean`, and `RandomSeriesLaw.lean` identifies the
unit-interval law with the affine image of the up measure.
`CauchyTransform.lean` defines the report-sign Cauchy--Stieltjes transforms and
proves their measure forms, the up-density form, holomorphy off the named interval cuts,
first-derivative kernel formulas, and the affine bridge
`S(z) = 2 R(2z - 1)`.  `CauchyCDF.lean` proves atom-exact compact-support
integration by parts for arbitrary finite measures with almost-everywhere
interval support, its probability-CDF normalization, and
`S(z) = (z - 1)⁻¹ - ∫₀¹ F(t) (z - t)⁻² dt` off `[0,1]`.
`CauchyRenormalization.lean` proves that both dyadic branches preserve the
up-transform slit domain, establishes
`R'(z) = 2 (R(2z + 1) - R(2z - 1))` there, and instantiates the reusable
`AffineDifferenceOrbit.lean` engine to obtain the exact all-order finite
Thue--Morse derivative orbit.  The logarithmic fixed point, the separate
higher-Cauchy-kernel integral identity, a named Stieltjes-transform DDE,
boundary/Plemelj formulas, moment/Laurent expansions, generalized order, and
Jacobi/Padé theory remain open.)

The reciprocal-Gamma portion of Part II is now formal at source checkpoint
`71ab6f6728fceb753c88d8b0573077a59acf2682`.  The reusable convergence engine
is `ScaledInfiniteProducts.lean`; `GeometricReciprocalGamma.lean` constructs
the entire product
`G_q(z) = product_n Gamma(1 + q^n z)^(-1)` for complex `q` with `‖q‖ < 1`,
proves its Mahler equation, zero orbit, reflection, and dyadic Rvachev bridge;
and `DyadicGammaOrder.lean` proves the exact negative-integer zero set and
dyadic zero/pole orders.  The Gamma-side functions are totalized pointwise
inverses, with poles recorded by negative meromorphic order.  Still open are
the raw Gamma tprod away from its poles, arithmetic canonical regrouping,
logarithmic/digamma/Malmsten/heat/integral identities, D-finiteness,
general-base pole orders, and the reciprocal-Gamma derivative coefficient
needed by the separate Thue--Morse tower.

That paragraph is retained as the historical
`71ab6f6728fceb753c88d8b0573077a59acf2682` boundary.  The current overlay pins
the next tranche to `0ba35abd4`: the five public declarations of
`ReciprocalGammaJets.lean` are `deriv_Gamma_inv_neg_nat`,
`hasDerivAt_Gamma_inv_neg_nat`, `hasDerivAt_Gamma_inv_zero`,
`analyticOrderAt_Gamma_inv_neg_nat`, and `tendsto_Gamma_inv_div_add_nat`.
They establish the exact first jet, simple analytic order, and punctured local
coefficient of the entire reciprocal Gamma function at every nonpositive
integer, without assigning a derivative to raw Gamma at a pole.

The first eight public declarations of `ThueMorseGammaTower.lean` at that commit
are `hasDerivAt_dirichletMellinContinuation_neg_nat`,
`deriv_dirichletMellinContinuation_neg_nat`, `thueMorseGammaLog`,
`thueMorseGammaTower`, `thueMorseGammaLog_eq_mellin`,
`thueMorseGammaLog_eq_integral`, `thueMorseGammaLog_dyadic`, and
`thueMorseGammaTower_dyadic`; the current integrated tree adds
`ofReal_exp_mpLimit_eq_gammaTower_div` as the ninth.  Their definitions are
total for every real parameter, while the Mellin, integral, dyadic, and ratio
theorems use positive parameters.  GammaLog is a chosen derivative coordinate,
not a proved `Complex.log` identity.  Only the parameter differential/iterated
ladder remains open within this tower; the raw Gamma tprod, arithmetic
canonical regrouping, Gamma-product logarithmic/digamma/Malmsten/heat-trace
identities, D-finiteness, and general-base pole orders remain separate
frontiers.

The mathematical bodies of the member drafts were preserved (labels,
citation keys, and asset paths were mechanically prefixed per part),
with top-level counters and reproduction instructions adapted to the
consolidated layout. Their standalone TeX/PDF pairs were deleted;
provenance with SHA-256 hashes is recorded in the volume itself, and git
history is the archive. Reproducibility files remain under the volume's
`assets/` directory, with each former package's README updated for its
new location.

The five second-wave reports that arrived 2026-08-28 were
consolidated the same day into the companion volume
[`Representation_Second_Wave/`](Representation_Second_Wave/)
(183 pp, five parts): I — *Integral, Series, Product, and Operator
Representations* (formerly `fabius_rvachev_report_package/`);
II — *Polyphase, Operator, and Jump-Measure Representations*
(formerly `Fabius_Rvachev_Polyphase_Representation_Report/`);
III — *Sampling, Padé, Mellin, Resolvent, and Product–Integral
Representations* (formerly
`Fabius_Rvachev_Thue_Morse_Representation_Frontiers/`);
IV — *Unit-Circle, Bessel, and Spectral–Monodromy Representations*
(formerly `rvachev_fabius_representations_2026/`);
V — *Dyadic Multiresolution and Sampling Frontiers* (formerly
`Fabius_Rvachev_Multiresolution_Representations/`).  Same mechanical
content-preserving merge as the first volume; absorbed member
directories deleted, provenance with SHA-256 in the volume.

The two fourth-wave polynomial-representation drafts (2026-08-28) were
merged the same day into the volume
[`Up_Polynomial_Synthesis/`](Up_Polynomial_Synthesis/) (*Exact
Polynomial Synthesis from Rvachev Up-Atoms*, 22 pp): the common-scale
dictionary construction (formerly
`Rvachev_Up_Polynomial_Representation_Package/`, *Exact Polynomial
Synthesis by Finite Rvachev Up-Function Dictionaries*) and the
antiderivative-train window construction (formerly
`rvachev_up_polynomial_representation/`, *Exact Polynomial Windows from
Finite Sums of Shifted and Scaled Rvachev up Functions*).  Unlike the
mechanical merges above, this is an editorial consolidation: shared
foundations stated once, the two constructions compared, the minimal
atom count sharpened to `N_d <= d+2`, and the canonical defect
identified with the shifted-quadrature first failure of the
`Dyadic_Comb_Frontiers` volume (exact special values via the spectral
Dirichlet values `D(2r)`).  A third source, the seventh-wave draft
`Rvachev_Up_Exact_Polynomial_Representation_Report/` (*Exact
Polynomial Plateaux from Rvachev's Up-Function*), was absorbed the
same day as the oversampled-lattice chapter: twisted Poisson
summation, exact reproduction order `v_2(m)` at radius-to-spacing
ratio `m` with the general-ratio defect series, the physical-scale
interval algorithm (`O(d)`-element description, `(2m+1)`-local
evaluation, full endpoint-jet matching), ghost-atom antiderivative
calculus, the exact Thue–Morse dyadic derivative stencil (convolution
inverse of the ladder's binary-partition weights), finite sinc-prefix
generators with the exact cumulant truncation law, and
odd-denominator cumulant arithmetic; its rational-arithmetic
verification package lives under
`assets/Rvachev_Up_Exact_Polynomial_Representation_Report/`.
Absorbed directories deleted; provenance with SHA-256 in the volume's
Appendix B and `assets/SHA256SUMS-absorbed.txt`.
