# Representations

Series and orthogonal-expansion representations of the up-function,
consolidated (2026-08-28) into the single volume
[`Representation_Frontiers/`](Representation_Frontiers/) (107 pp):

- **Part I** — *Resolvent, Continued-Fraction, and Transform
  Representations of the Fabius–Rvachev System* (Jacobi coefficients,
  exact even moments, resolvent and logarithmic-derivative identities;
  formerly
  `Fabius_Rvachev_Representation_Frontiers/`);
- **Part II** — *Representation Atlas and New Analytic Bridges for the
  Fabius Function, Rvachev's Up-Function, and Their Fourier Images*
  (formerly `fabius_rvachev_representation_frontier/`);
- **Part III** — *Dyadic Multiresolution and Product–Series
  Representations* (rational mass arrays, Haar–Schauder expansions,
  Walsh–Thue–Morse products, beta-mixture limits, Bell–Bernoulli scale
  energies, inverse-quantile duality; formerly
  `Fabius_Rvachev_Multiresolution_Report/`).

(The random-variable representation itself is formalized in
`ProbabilityRepresentation.lean`.  The reusable affine-difference iterate,
open-domain derivative propagation theorem, and dyadic Thue--Morse orbit are
formalized in `AffineDifferenceOrbit.lean`.  The Cauchy--Stieltjes transform of
the up measure and its one-step resolvent DDE are still open; the affine module
formalizes only the conditional passage from that identity to its all-order
orbit.)

The mathematical bodies of the member drafts were preserved (labels,
citation keys, and asset paths were mechanically prefixed per part),
with top-level counters and reproduction instructions adapted to the
consolidated layout. Their standalone TeX/PDF pairs were deleted;
provenance with SHA-256 hashes is recorded in the volume itself, and git
history is the archive. Reproducibility files remain under the volume's
`assets/` directory, with each former package's README updated for its
new location.

See [`../MANIFEST.md`](../MANIFEST.md) for titles and provenance.
