# Exposition and proof review record

This records the scope of the September 22, 2026 documentation review. It is
separate from [Lean coverage](FORMALIZATION.md): an expanded mathematical proof,
a finite regression check and a compiled Lean theorem are different evidence.
No row below certifies every claim in an entire report.

## Reviewed portions and corrections

| Report | Inspected portion and result |
|---|---|
| [Foundations](foundations-and-computation/foundations/) | Expanded `found:thm:workspace` with arithmetic and universe-smallness prerequisites; supplied the missing positive, well-ordered control-set hypothesis in `found:prop:positive`. Distinguished intrinsic modulus/valuation topology from the full fine subspace topology. Proved the geometric convergence criterion and added `found:ex:boundedrankone`. |
| [Dynamics](surcomplex/dynamics-and-normal-forms/) | Corrected `dyn:cor:ancestry` to retain input support, proved finite dependence by word/block decompositions, and checked its arbitrary-input uses. The specialized linearizer counts an initial positive letter and retains its stronger bound. Corrected the blanket claim that changing exponent orientation reverses every inequality. |
| [Physics](physics/surreal-scalars-and-spacetime/) | Expanded `phys:prop:pole` and corrected abstract, conclusion and summaries: formal ramification preserves the pole but changes the coefficient by `w(0)^(−p)`. Distinguished the normalized recorded tests from the general theorem. |
| [Analytic geometry](surcomplex/analytic-geometry/) | Corrected `analytic:conv:notation` to define standard-part topology on finite tuples and explain its indiscrete zero-monad restriction. In `analytic:rem:fixed-not-transferred`, showed explicitly why the fixed-disk corona pair generates the whole common-domain germ ring after shrinking. |
| [Trigonometry](surcomplex/trigonometry/) | Corrected the infinitesimal-ideal notation and stated the nonzero-denominator condition in the asymptotic conventions. |
| [Computable surreals](foundations-and-computation/computable-surreals/) | Reviewed numerical names, basic ring operations, gap extraction and inversion. Added the missing output-range filter in `lem:geom`, qualified `prop:topology` by index size, repaired the runner/build paths, and tested the candidate-cover contract with negative zero candidates. |
| [Hahn evaluation at omega](surreal/hahn-evaluation-at-omega/) | Reviewed the elementary ring/semiring obstruction witnesses and formal square-root lemmas. Corrected the false logical-incomparability claim: restriction and a unique extension by differences identify the two kinds of maps into a commutative ring. The direct positive-coefficient witness remains a distinct proof. |

Each correction was reviewed against its local definitions and downstream uses
within the stated scope. Changed PDFs were rebuilt and affected pages inspected.
The dynamics PDF retains its three pre-existing small overfull boxes; the
evaluation-at-omega PDF retains its baseline font/layout warnings. Finite
symbolic checks support the physics examples; the corrected computability runner
passes its four separately counted suites. Its new cover regression fails when
the range filter is removed. These checks do not prove infinite statements.

## Collection-wide work

The [reader map](README.md), [catalogue](manifest.tex) and
[notation guide](NOTATION.md) cover all 26 canonical reports. The guide records
meaningful differences rather than treating shared names as definitions:
coefficient domains, support orientation, scalar standard part versus function
reduction, topologies, strong sums, derivatives, phases and computational names.
Its report links and cited labels were checked. Maintained Markdown navigation
was checked separately from deliberately historical paths in verification records.
Original manuscript archives are accessed through Git history; their removal
from the current tree does not discharge source-claim reconciliation.

## Remaining scope

The remaining portions of the seven reports above still need systematic proof
review. The other nineteen main reports have been mapped for notation and
navigation but have not received a full mathematical review in this pass:

- Broadcast sums; canonical forms and option graphs; exponential automorphism
  rigidity; Gamma functions; genetic gaps and primitives; both birthday reports.
- Surcomplex analysis; contours and Stokes; differential equations; entire
  functions at arbitrary rank; finite deformations; global divisors; nonabelian
  support; polynomial algebra; rank-one Berkovich geometry; spectral theory.
- Surquaternions; computer algebra.

Continue with elementary statements and their dependencies before broad
classification theorems. For each portion, check definitions and size/domain
hypotheses, reconstruct abbreviated arguments, inspect downstream uses of any
correction, align terminology with the guide, and rebuild the affected document.
A source-to-merged-claim reconciliation is still required where a report's
provenance account alone does not establish equivalent scope.
